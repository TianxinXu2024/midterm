        <h2>The Aromatic Evolution: Birth of Scented Candles</h2>

        <p>The history of handmade aromatherapy candles dates back centuries, with the practice rooted in ancient civilizations. The earliest records of candle-making can be traced to the Egyptians, who used rushlights or torches made from soaked reeds in animal fat. The Greeks and Romans improved upon these early methods, utilizing tallow, a form of animal fat, to create candles for both practical and ceremonial purposes.</p>

        <p2>In medieval Europe, candle-making became a specialized craft, primarily using beeswax obtained from beekeepers. Beeswax candles were highly prized for their pleasant aroma and cleaner, longer burn. Monasteries played a significant role in candle production during this period, and the techniques were closely guarded secrets.</p2>

        <p3>The Renaissance era witnessed advancements in candle-making techniques, including the introduction of molds and wicks made from cotton. However, it was not until the 19th century that paraffin wax, derived from petroleum, revolutionized the industry. This new material was more affordable and accessible, leading to mass production.
